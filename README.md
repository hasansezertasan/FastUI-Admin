**Please note:** FastUI Admin is still an active work in progress, do not expect it to be complete.

> I can't get very far with this project as FastUI itself is still a baby. That's why the development process continues in another repository called [fastui-tutorials](https://github.com/hasansezertasan/fastui-tutorials). Those who are interested and want to contribute can visit the repo. Even if you are not interested, I recommend checking out this repository as it is a good resource to learn FastUI.
